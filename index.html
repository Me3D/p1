    <p>Name: Mark Stites</p>
    <p>I'm a network engineer and like to build 3D printers. I've coded in pretty much everything, although I do not consider myself a programmer. I prefer Linux, but have a few Mac's laying around here.</p>
    <p>As for code editing, on Linux I tend to use nano at the cli, or Komodo-Edit when I want something GUI. On my Mac I'll use BBEdit.</p>
